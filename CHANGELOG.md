# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Thinking `max` maps to reasoning effort `max` on `muse-spark-1.3` (the only Muse model Meta accepts it on); server-advertised `variants.max` still wins.
- Per-key entitlement probe for `reasoning.encrypted_content`: the include is stripped for keys Meta rejects, so cross-turn reasoning never 400s.
- API-key login: `/login meta` offers pasting a Model API key as an alternative to the browser device flow. Pasted keys are validated against `GET /v1/models`, stored with a `static-api-key:` refresh marker, and passed through unchanged by the daily refresh.

### Changed

- Support pi 0.85.x: peer range `>=0.83.0 <0.86.0`, devDeps 0.85.1.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Direct expired Meta identity-token sessions back to `/login meta` when API-key minting returns HTTP 401 or 403.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-04

### Removed

- Voice dictation, platform audio helpers, and Meta ASR integration from the OAuth-only branch.
- Media analysis tools, commands, upload helpers, and request rewriting from the OAuth-only branch.
- Unused `@earendil-works/pi-tui` and `typebox` runtime peer dependencies.

### Changed

- Register only `extensions/meta.ts` and advertise only Pi-native text and image model inputs.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Send `prompt_cache_retention: "24h"` on Meta Responses requests (chat hook and direct media calls). Muse prompt caching is opt-in and measured ~0% on `/chat/completions` vs 93–99% on `/responses` with this hint.
- Strip `reasoning.effort: "none"` from outbound payloads — Meta 400s on it.
- Hermetic wire-contract tests for the Responses URL, retention setdefault/override, reasoning omit/passthrough, session `prompt_cache_key` stability, contributor cache pricing, and the ASR handshake JSON.
- Optional live prompt-cache probe (`PI_META_LIVE_API_KEY`, or any already-available Meta credential) that performs two identical Responses calls — plus one retry on a cache miss — and asserts `cached_tokens`.
- Bundled model metadata for `muse-spark-1.3` and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor`.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Persist the live Meta catalog to `~/.pi/agent/models-store.json` after a successful network refresh, so external usage tools can show context-window percentages.
- Restore that cached catalog when Pi starts offline or without a Meta API key; bundled fallbacks remain the last resort.
- Compatibility adapter for both Pi 0.83 (`store` read/write) and Pi 0.84 (`stored` / `publish`).
- Contributor-model privacy note for `muse-spark-1.2-contributor`.
- Documented `MUSE_VOICE_ASR_ENDPOINT` / `MUSE_VOICE_ASR_MODEL` aliases (`PI_META_*` takes precedence).

### Fixed

- Treat Pi 0.84's `AbortSignal` as token-refresh cancellation instead of a `fetch` mock, so `/login meta` key rotation works on Pi 0.84.2.
- Do not persist or publish an empty catalog; restore the previous cache when a refresh returns no models or fails on the network.
- Force `store:false` and Files API promotion for large media in tool `output` arrays and ordinary `input_image` data URLs, avoiding Meta's ~20 MB `store=true` 413 limit.
- Rewrite media HTTPS URLs that include query strings or fragments.
- Validate video/audio MIME types from the full source URL, not only the path suffix.
- Honor abort signals on Files API uploads and check the 1 GiB size limit before buffering the file.
- Stage macOS codesign and Windows `csc` output so a failed helper compile cannot leave a half-built binary that skips later signing.
- Sample every 16-bit PCM frame in the voice meter (2-byte stride, not 4).
- Complete a voice session on ASR close only for normal close codes 1000/1005.

### Changed

- Split media internals into `extensions/media/{limits,mime,files,responses,payload}.ts`.
- Split voice ASR/auth/PCM and helper builds into `extensions/voice/asr.ts` and `extensions/voice/helpers.ts`.
- Pi entrypoints are unchanged: `extensions/meta.ts`, `extensions/media.ts`, `extensions/voice.ts`.
- Document that the catalog cache is written during interactive/RPC startup and after `/login meta`. `pi --list-models meta` lists models but does not trigger a network catalog refresh.
